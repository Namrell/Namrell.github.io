Under my 1.5 years as a user of a 3D-printer I have spent more time reworking my printer, either to get the quality up
or because I wanted to try some new parts than actually printing on it. It's just in the last few months when I'm printing
some game pieces for a 
friend that I have started to look into the reliability of the printer. Times have changed and to have a printer where
there is a 50% chance that the print will be ruined from poor bed adhesion, overheated stepper drivers or some other failure
is no longer acceptable to me, and it's damn uninspiring. My main problem have been bed adhesion where I (for ABS) used to tweak
the nozzle so close to the bed that the first layer was practical see-through and for some reason I tried hair-spray, heated bed
and gluestick but not <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/ABS-Juice-and-Slurry-Getting-your-Prints-to-Stick/">ABS-juice</a>.
That changed yesterday and I did try and I can happily say that it works really well even with an unheated bed. I still use a
relatively wide brim because my second try sprouted some warping.

There will be a lot of saved energy to not need to use the heated bed, and with no problem with layers splitting I can
at the moment not really see a reason to use a heated bed. Earlier this month I started using gluestick with PLA and
that really stuck the print on there good, so no heat needed for me! There is of course some added resources that gets
depleted and my guess is that Acetone is poorer for the environment than the energy used in a heated bed, at least here
in Sweden where the energy is green for the most part. In the future I will try to find some environment friendly glue that
is easy to clean of and give that a try, untill then it's ABS-juice for me.
