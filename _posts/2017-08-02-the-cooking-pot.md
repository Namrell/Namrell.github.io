I have continued to add some small changes to the webpage. Mostly just a standardization of font size, a favicon and
the possibility to add comments to the posts. The favicon was found in a webpage with a lot of open source icons and will
be switched or altered in the future. It is also the change I'm most glad of since it looks pretty! I'm not certain that I
will keep the comments functionality, mostly because it takes some time to load which felt a bit uninspiring.

Last but not least I have a picture at the top of my page! It's from when my printer was newly built and I had to run the
filament roll in a cooking pot. Those were the days.
